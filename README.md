## Project Description:
Through our diet tracking website, NARMTrack, users are able to track and manage their caloric intake. By using NARMTrack, users are able to obtain dietary information, including calories and nutrients, of each food they search for in the website. This will help individuals struggling with obesity by facilitating and easing the process of losing weight, which requires a caloric deficit. Tracking these calories can be an overwhelming and time-consuming task that can often prevent people from achieving their weight-loss goals, which inspired NARMTrackâ€™s features. What happens if an individual is unaware of whether or not they are obese? To help with this, NARMTrack also includes a built-in BMI calculator, which helps users determine whether or not their weight-to-height ratio falls under normal ranges. Additionally, obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes are targeted by NARMTrack by helping users reduce their sugar content through features that allow them to filter meals by their sugar content level as well as providing their actual content in grams.
